Introduction
==========================

Sometimes you need a complete TCR nucleotide or amino acid sequence, but
all you have is limited information. This script aims to generate a
coding nucleotide sequence for a given rearrangement (e.g.Â for use when
generating TCR expression vectors) in those situations.

The script takes the known V/J/CDR3 information, and uses that to pull
out the relevant germline TCR nucleotide sequences and stitch them
together. Its modular approach can be used for the automated generation
of TCR sequences for gene synthesis and functional testing, or for TCR
engineering through supplying modified germline sequences.

Out of the box, ``stitchr`` works on all common jawed vertebrate TCR
loci (alpha/beta/gamma/delta), for all species for which there is
currently data available in IMGT.
