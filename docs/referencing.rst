Citing ``stitchr``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The manuscript describing and validating ``stitchr`` is available here:

James M Heather, Matthew J Spindler, Marta Herrero Alonso, Yifang Ivana Shui, David G Millar, David S Johnson, Mark Cobbold, Aaron N Hata, ``Stitchr``: stitching coding TCR nucleotide sequences from V/J/CDR3 information, Nucleic Acids Research, 2022, gkac190, `https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac190 <https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac190>`_.

The corresponding analyses and related datasets are available `here <https://github.com/JamieHeather/stitchr-paper-analysis>`_ (which used `v1.0.0 <https://github.com/JamieHeather/stitchr/releases/tag/v1.0.0>`_ ``stitchr`` scripts).

This citation can be printed in the command line by running ``stitchr --cite``. This command will also output a summary of the underlying data as downloaded from the reference source (particularly the release ID and download date) for every species locally available, which ideally should be reported when publishing sequences produced using ``stitchr`` for reproducibility purposes.
